C                        PRINCIPLE POSSIBLE TO INDEX ANY PATTERN AS TRICLINIC,
C                        THE INDEXING ALGORITHM USED HERE IS MORE
C                        EFFECTIVE FOR TRUE TRICLINIC THAN FOR PSEUDO-
C                        TRICLINIC PATTERNS. FOR EXAMPLE A MONOCLINIC PATTERN
C                        MAY BE CORRECTLY INDEXED BY A TRICLINIC CELL (USING
C                        TRIC=1) BUT THIS IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE.
C                        FURTHERMORE, THE TRICLINIC TEST IS TIMECONSUMING
C                        (TYPICAL 10-20 MINUTES CPU-TIME ON A VAX 11/750).
C                        OBS. FOR A TRUE TRICLINIC CELL THE PARAMETER VOL
C                        MAY BE GIVEN THE ESTIMATED VALUE (C.F. THE WARNINGS
C                        GIVEN ABOVE -SEE  S T R A T E G Y....) PLUS
